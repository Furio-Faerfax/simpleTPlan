# simpleTPlan v1.1.0
A simple Time planner, made to track my day on specific tasks, without any pressure to hold on a strict time plan/block

Currently features a 4 column based planning structure, with a "planned" and an "is" time counter.  
If you want to clear the field completely(including the sleep card, just toggle the switch in the menu for that option.  
(Tasks with the Name "Sleep" currently gets blocked from clearing without the toggle, in a future Version I will add a system to add other potentially unclearable tasks)  
You can Save, load and even toggle a mode to autoload the last saved table.

You can move the tasks in the done column by clicking the empty checkbox icon in the right bottom corner, when you hovber there with the mouse
Start and pause the time tracking with a click on the stopwatch icon on the left bottom corner
reposition the tasks by clicking thge arrows on the left side of a card when you hover with the mouse over it
